This project is a grid maker, you can add rows and columns by clicking on those buttons, it will always create a complete grid rectangle so there arenâ€™t any gaps. you can choose to remove rows and columns as well. There is a button to fill out all of the uncolored cells in the grid with a user-specified color from the dropdown menu, or you can override that and fill all of the cells with a certain color regardless if it has been colored or not. You can also color each cell by clicking on it when a color is selected.
